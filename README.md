# Junk_File_Organizer
A file organizer can become very messy when a folder is full of different types of files. Without proper organization, it can be difficult to locate specific files and to keep track of what is stored in the folder. Additionally, having a large number of unorganized files can make it harder to manage and back up the data stored in the folder. It can also be difficult to see at a glance what types of files are stored in the folder, making it harder to decide which files are no longer needed and can be deleted. Overall, it is important to keep folders organized to ensure that it is easy to access and manage the data stored within them.
The Folder Wise File Organizer script is a simple and efficient tool that can save users a lot of time and effort in organizing their files. It can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of the user, and because of its dictionary of various file types it ensures that all files in the specified root folder are organized. 
Our project helps users to organize their files by moving them into appropriate folders based on their file types. This can be particularly useful for users who have a large number of files scattered across various locations on their computer and are looking for an easy way to sort and organize them.
